    [Test bugs]
		Perl 5.21.2 introduced a new warning, redundant, which
		fired when sprintf was being called with too many arguments.
		Cope with this warning, and switch the printf test to test
		something that won't also fire a redundant warning.

		Thanks to Slaven Rezic for reminding me of this failure.

	[Test bugs]
		Perl 5.8.9 didn't think a dodgy unpack warranted a warning, so
		switched to something that all perls agree is dodgy.

        worth.

    [Documentation]
		Added a note about not being able to disable compile-time
		warnings like experimental::smartmatch.
		
        Very minor typo fix.

		Fixed test failures with Pod::Coverage <= 0.21.

		reliably across all versions and platforms.
